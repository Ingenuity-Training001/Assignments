I have made a todo list in my second assignment as a part of training.
I used HTML,CSS and JavaScript in this project.
In this assignment my aim is to make a list in which user have to input the data.
I used an add button in it with the help of Bootstrap.
The first click on the data will bring linethrough on the data and second click will remove the data from the list.
